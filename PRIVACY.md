Threads.com Auto-Following & Clean UI does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users.

- No personal information is collected.
- No browsing history is stored.
- No data is transmitted to external servers.

The extension runs entirely in the user's browser and only modifies the display of Threads.com pages to automatically open the "Following" feed and hide certain UI elements.
